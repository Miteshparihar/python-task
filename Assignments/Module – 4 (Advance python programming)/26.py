What is Instantiation in terms of OOP terminology?
Ans:-
       In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) terminology, instantiation refers to the process
       of creating an instance (object) of a class. An instance is a concrete, individual representation
       of a class, and it has its own unique attributes and can perform actions as defined by the class.

Class Definition: In OOP, you define a class to create a blueprint or a template for objects.
A class specifies the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that its instances will have.

Object Creation: To use a class, you create one or more instances of that class. This process of creating an instance is called instantiation.

Attributes and Methods: Each instance of a class has its own set of attributes, which are often initialized
during instantiation using a constructor method (e.g., __init__ in Python).
Instances can also call the methods defined in the class.

Independence: Instances created from the same class are independent of each other. Changes to one
instance's attributes or method invocations do not affect other instances of the same class.

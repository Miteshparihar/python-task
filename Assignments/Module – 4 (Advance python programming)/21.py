'''What are oops concepts? Is multiple inheritance supported in java
Ans:-
         Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm
         that is based on the concept of "objects." Objects represent real-world entities
         and encapsulate both data (attributes or properties) and the methods (functions)
         that operate on that data.


        Java supports single inheritance, meaning a class can inherit from only one superclass.
        Java supports multiple interfaces.

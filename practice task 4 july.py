# Average =sum of values / Number of values 
print("The last three months electricity bills have been $23,$32 and $64.")
print("Find average montly electricity bill :-?")
print("Average= sum of values / Number of values")
print("Number of values:- 3")
print("sum of values :- $23+$32+$64")
sum= 23+32+64
print("sum:-$",sum)
print("Average=$119/3")
Average = sum/3
print("Average montly electricity bill is $",Average)
